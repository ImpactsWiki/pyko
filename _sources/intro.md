# pyKO hydrocode

pyKO is a 1d Lagrangian Elastic-Plastic Hydrocode written in python.
This code was developed from the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-03885-7">Computer Simulation of Dynamic Phenomena by Mark Wilkins</a> (Springer-Verlag, 1999) and the <a href="https://www.eng.mu.edu/shockphysics/KO/">fortran KO code v11 by John Borg</a>.

This resource is available as part of the <a href="https://impacts.wiki">Impacts Community Wiki Project</a>. This code is an easily modifiable and expandable teaching/learning tool that can be run in a Jupyter notebook.

This code is currently in development (https://github.com/StewartGroup/ko-hydrocode) and a public release will be available in the future at https://github.com/ImpactsWiki/pyko.
