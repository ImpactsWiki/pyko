# pyKO hydrocode

pyKO is a one-dimensional Lagrangian elastic-plastic hydrocode written in python.
This code was developed from the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-03885-7">Computer Simulation of Dynamic Phenomena by Mark Wilkins</a> (Springer-Verlag, 1999) and the <a href="https://www.eng.mu.edu/shockphysics/KO/">fortran KO code v11 by John Borg</a>.

This resource is available as part of the <a href="https://impacts.wiki">Impacts Community Wiki Project</a>. This code is an easily modifiable and expandable teaching/learning tool that can be run in a Jupyter notebook.

This code is currently in beta testing and a public release will be available in the future at https://github.com/ImpactsWiki/pyko. If you are interested in beta testing, please contact `ststewart[at]ucdavis.edu`.
